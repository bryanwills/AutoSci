# ΩmegaWiki — Runtime Schema (bio-adaptation, Section B)

> **Mirror copy of `i18n/en/CLAUDE.md`.** Source of truth: `i18n/en/CLAUDE.md`. This file applies the
> CLAUDE.md-touching parts of items B1–B3 from `docs/bioinformatics-adaptation-backlog.en.md`.
> Per-item diff: `docs/bio-adaptation/CHANGELOG.en.md`.
>
> **Independent of `section-a/CLAUDE.md`.** Both mirrors are derived from the same source and target
> the same merge destination, but each contains only its own section's hunks so they can be
> cherry-picked independently. When merging, apply Section A's hunks first, then Section B's.
>
> Once Section B is adopted, merge this file into `i18n/en/CLAUDE.md` and run `./setup.sh --lang en`.

> CS/AI ΩmegaWiki. Powered by Claude Code.
> This file is the wiki's runtime entry point: defines page structure, link conventions, and workflow constraints.

> **Maintenance note**: Managed under `i18n/`. Edit `i18n/en/CLAUDE.md` (not the active copy at the root). Run `./setup.sh --lang <current>` to sync.

## Repository Layout

Open `docs/runtime-directory-structure.en.md` only when you need the full repo tree.

Keep this mental map in immediate context:

### `wiki/` is the main product surface

- `wiki/index.md` is the catalog of all wiki pages
- `wiki/log.md` is the append-only activity log
- `wiki/papers/` holds paper summaries
- `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/topics/`, and `wiki/foundations/` hold reusable knowledge structure
- `wiki/people/`, `wiki/ideas/`, `wiki/experiments/`, and `wiki/claims/` hold research actors, hypotheses, tests, and assertions
- `wiki/Summary/` holds area-level syntheses
- `wiki/outputs/` holds generated artifacts
- `wiki/graph/` is derived state; do not edit it manually

### Formatting guardrail

- Open `docs/runtime-page-templates.en.md` before drafting or repairing wiki page structure, YAML, or body sections
- Open `docs/runtime-support-files.en.md` when you need graph-derived file details or `index.md` / `log.md` format
- `SKILL.md` is the immediate entrypoint for a skill; some larger skills may also provide local on-demand reference files under their skill directory
- `/init` is the first concrete example of this pattern: read `skills/init/SKILL.md` first, then open `skills/init/references/*` only when needed

### `raw/` and `config/`

- `raw/papers/`, `raw/notes/`, and `raw/web/` are user-owned inputs
- `raw/discovered/` stores externally fetched papers from `/init` and `/daily-arxiv`
- `raw/tmp/` stores generated prepared local sidecars for `/init` and direct local `/ingest`
- `config/` holds environment and remote-server templates

---

## 9 Page Types

`papers`, `concepts`, `topics`, `people`, `ideas`, `experiments`, `claims`, `Summary`, `foundations`.

Open `docs/runtime-page-templates.en.md` for page templates and `docs/runtime-support-files.en.md` for graph/index/log references.

---

## Link Syntax

All internal links use Obsidian wikilinks:

```markdown
[[slug]]                    ← link to any page in this wiki
[[lora-low-rank-adaptation]] ← links to papers/lora-low-rank-adaptation.md
[[flash-attention]]          ← links to concepts/flash-attention.md
```

**Naming convention**: all lowercase, hyphen-separated, no spaces.

---

## Cross-Reference Rules

When writing a forward link, **always write the reverse link simultaneously**:

| Forward action | Required reverse action |
|----------------|------------------------|
| papers/A writes `Related: [[concept-B]]` | concepts/B appends A to `key_papers` |
| papers/A writes `[[researcher-C]]` | people/C appends A to `Key papers` |
| papers/A writes `supports: [[claim-D]]` | claims/D appends `{source: A, type: supports}` to `evidence` |
| topics/T writes `key_people: [[person-D]]` | people/D appends T to `Research areas` |
| concepts/K writes `key_papers: [[paper-E]]` | papers/E appends K to `Related` |
| concepts/K writes part_of `[[topic-F]]` | topics/F appends K to overview paragraph |
| ideas/I writes `origin_gaps: [[claim-C]]` | claims/C appends I to `## Linked ideas` |
| experiments/E writes `target_claim: [[claim-C]]` | claims/C appends `{source: E, type: tested_by}` to `evidence` |
| claims/C writes `source_papers: [[paper-P]]` | papers/P appends C to `## Related` |
| any page links to `[[foundation-X]]` | **no reverse link** — foundations are terminal: they receive inward links from papers/concepts/etc. but never write `key_papers` or any back-reference field |

<!-- bio-B1/B2/B3: graph-rules block extended with bio relation edges, validation/translation edges,
     and dataset-version provenance edges. Edge enumeration grouped for readability. -->
## Graph Rules

- `graph/` is auto-generated; do not edit it manually
- core derived files are `edges.jsonl`, `citations.jsonl`, `context_brief.md`, and `open_questions.md`
- semantic edge types are grouped as follows. **All non-citation edges require `confidence: high|medium|low`.**
  - **paper-paper** (existing): `same_problem_as`, `similar_method_to`, `complementary_to`, `builds_on`, `compares_against`, `improves_on`, `challenges`, `surveys`
  - **paper-concept** (existing): `introduces_concept`, `uses_concept`, `extends_concept`, `critiques_concept`
  - **claim / experiment / provenance** (existing): `supports`, `contradicts`, `tested_by`, `invalidates`, `addresses_gap`, `derived_from`, `inspired_by`
  - <!-- bio-B1 --> **bio relation edges** (paper / claim / concept → protein, or protein → protein): `targets_protein`, `binds`, `inhibits`, `activates`, `degrades`, `phosphorylates`, `ubiquitinates`, `methylates`, `acetylates`, `is_substrate_of` (reverse of the four PTM verbs)
  - <!-- bio-B2 --> **validation / translation edges** (claim / paper → indication / cohort): `clinical_trial_for`, `fda_approved_for`, `validates_in_species`
  - <!-- bio-B3 --> **dataset-version provenance edge** (experiment → dataset): `dataset_version_used`
- `/ingest` paper-paper and paper-concept semantic edges must include `confidence: high|medium|low`
- <!-- bio-B1 --> bio relation edges (`targets_protein`, `binds`, …, `is_substrate_of`) must also include `confidence`
- <!-- bio-B2/B3 --> validation/translation and dataset-version edges carry typed attributes in a nested `metadata` object — see edge JSON schema in `docs/runtime-support-files.en.md`
- symmetric paper-paper edges are stored once with sorted endpoints and `symmetric: true`
- bibliographic citations live in `citations.jsonl` as `type: cites`
- use `tools/research_wiki.py add-edge`, `add-citation`, `rebuild-context-brief`, and `rebuild-open-questions`

## log.md Format

Standard log line:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] skill | details
```

---

## Python Environment

- prefer `.venv/bin/python` (Unix/macOS) or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows) when `.venv/` exists
- otherwise use the active conda env if present
- otherwise fall back to `python3` (Unix/macOS) or `python` (Windows)
- Python tools auto-load API keys from `~/.env` and project-root `.env` via `tools/_env.py`

---

## Constraints

- **`raw/papers/`, `raw/notes/`, `raw/web/` are user-owned**: treat them as authoritative inputs. `/init` and `/daily-arxiv` may add externally fetched papers only under `raw/discovered/`. `/init` and direct local `/ingest` may add generated prepared local sidecars under `raw/tmp/` (additions only — never overwrite an existing user-owned file). `/edit` may add raw sources only when the user explicitly asked for it. `/init` subagents running `/ingest` in INIT MODE still treat `raw/` as strictly read-only and must consume the handed-off canonical path directly.
- **User-facing skill parameters are user-owned**: flags and values shown in a skill's `argument-hint` belong to the user's command, not to agent strategy. Do not invent, flip, or drop those parameters from repository state alone. If the user omitted a parameter, only use a default or derived value when that skill explicitly documents omission behavior; otherwise leave it unset or ask the user. Internal derived settings that are not user-facing parameters may still be inferred by the skill.
- **INIT MODE handoff is manifest-driven**: when `/init` writes `.checkpoints/init-sources.json`, that manifest becomes the single source of truth for ingest order and canonical source paths. Prepared local inputs should point to `raw/tmp/`; introduced external papers should point to `raw/discovered/`.
- **graph/ is auto-generated**: never manually edit files in `graph/` — only via `tools/research_wiki.py`.
- **Bidirectional links**: always write the reverse link when writing a forward link.
- **tex priority**: .tex > .pdf; fallback chain: tex fails → PDF parse, PDF fails → vision API.
- **index.md updated on every ingest**; log.md is append-only.
- **lint default is report-only**: `--fix` auto-fixes deterministic issues (xref backlinks, missing field defaults); `--suggest` outputs suggestions for non-deterministic issues; `--fix --dry-run` previews fixes.
- **Slug generation rule**: paper title keywords, hyphen-joined, all lowercase.
- **Importance scoring**: 1 = niche, 2 = useful, 3 = field-standard, 4 = influential, 5 = seminal.
- **Failed ideas must record reason**: `failure_reason` is anti-repetition memory — prevents re-exploring known dead ends.
- **Claim confidence range**: 0.0-1.0; re-evaluate every time evidence changes.
- **Experiments must link to a claim**: every experiment requires `target_claim`; results must be written back to the claim's evidence.
- **Experiment code goes in experiments/code/{slug}/**: `/exp-run` writes code to this path (`train.py`, `config.yaml`, `run.sh`, `requirements.txt`) — not to the project root or elsewhere.
- <!-- bio-B3 --> **Experiments referencing versioned datasets must record `dataset_version_used`**: when `experiments[*].setup.dataset` resolves to a `datasets/{slug}` page that has a non-empty `versions[]` list, an outgoing `dataset_version_used` edge with `metadata.version` is required. `/check` warns when the edge is missing or the recorded version is not present in `datasets/{slug}.versions[]`.
- **DeepXiv token**: `DEEPXIV_TOKEN` env variable. If unset, the SDK auto-registers (writes to `~/.env`). Free tier: 10,000 requests/day. When DeepXiv is unavailable, all skills fall back to S2+RSS mode.
